DESCRIPTION:--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opp
 ortunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your class
 mates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week\, desig
 ned to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the s
 criptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discu
 ssion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussio
 n fall on the same days as other activities this week\, each post in this 
 discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be
  most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstruction
 s\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity\, you will share three post
 s throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual ins
 tructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific gra
 ding criteria\, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses
 /341216/files/147260780/preview)  button at the top of this window and ch
 oose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n-------------------------
 -\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningf
 ul for you and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Tuesday. \
 n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned rea
 ding that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to add the referenc
 e to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n*
  Identify or restate that principle in your own words\, and put it in bold
  font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its 
 significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: "Therefore go\, my
  son\, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmure
 d." 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7\, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time
 \, I noticed something I hadn't focused on before. Nephi isn't just blesse
 d for being willing to return to Jerusalem\; he's blessed because he does 
 so with a good attitude. After all\, Laman and Lemuel make the trip\, but 
 they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn't jus
 t completing the action the Lord requires\, like going home teaching\, he 
 also requires that we obey with the right attitude\, like going home teach
 ing joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n \n\nPost 02 In
 creased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n--
 ----------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your c
 lassmates\, we recommend completing it by Thursday.\n\nFor the second post
 \, you will reply to a classmate's post. Try to add further insight or und
 erstanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a rela
 ted scripture or a quote from a church leader and then explaining how you 
 feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or princ
 iple being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great i
 nsight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that w
 e wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi's case\, I learned something in stu
 dying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice 
 was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-da
 y trip one way\, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi "had traveled t
 hree days in the wilderness . . . ." But the Institute Manual pointed out 
 that Lehi and his family first "came down by the borders near the shore of
  the Red Sea" (1 Nephi 5:6)\, which is "about 180 miles through hot\, barr
 en country infested anciently by many marauders." Combined with three days
  of traveling in the wilderness\, this means that the whole trip was "at l
 east a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way." This was not an easy task\, b
 ut Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in t
 he Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this ch
 allenge with a good attitude.\n\n \n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n-----
 -----------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third pos
 t\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Pick a post that you can make a 
 personal application to. You can either share a brief story of when you ha
 ve seen that principle in your life\, identify a way you are currently try
 ing to live that principle\, or share an example of a friend or family mem
 ber who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStud
 ent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by 
 my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to
  travel back 14 days\, retrieve something we left behind\, and then being 
 asked to return for another 14-day trip—that's 42 days of traveling! I m
 ight think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life
 \, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that\, but he ha
 s asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel l
 ike this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have ver
 y little free time as a student right now. However\, I know that when I ha
 ve a good attitude about this assignment\, it has helped me to love the si
 sters I visit and to have a better spirit as I've shared messages with the
 m. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient\, but it will always be the ri
 ght thing to do.\n\n \n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in th
 is activity before considering it complete.

 he posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote
  from a church leader and then explaining how you feel it adds additional 
 insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.</p
 ><h4>Example</h4><p><strong>Student 02:</strong> This is a great insight. 
 It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish w
 ould be a lot easier. In Nephi's case\, I learned something in studying th
 e Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in m
 aking the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip o
 ne way\, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi "had traveled three day
 s in the wilderness . . . ." But the Institute Manual pointed out that Leh
 i and his family first "came down by the borders near the shore of the Red
  Sea" (1 Nephi 5:6)\, which is "about 180 miles through hot\, barren count
 ry infested anciently by many marauders." Combined with three days of trav
 eling in the wilderness\, this means that the whole trip was "at least a t
 welve-to-fourteen-day trip one way." This was not an easy task\, but Nephi
  does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord 
 and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge 
 with a good attitude.</p><p>&nbsp\;</p></div><h3>Post 03 Personal Applicat
 ion</h3><div><h4>Instructions</h4><p>For the third post\, you will reply t
 o a classmate's post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application
  to. You can either share a brief story of when you have seen that princip
 le in your life\, identify a way you are currently trying to live that pri
 nciple\, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplif
 ied that principle to you.</p><h4>Example</h4><p><strong>Student 03:</stro
 ng> I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my d
 ad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to tra
 vel back 14 days\, retrieve something we left behind\, and then being aske
 d to return for another 14-day trip—that's 42 days of traveling! I might
  think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life\, t
 he prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that\, but he has as
 ked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like 
 this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very li
 ttle free time as a student right now. However\, I know that when I have a
  good attitude about this assignment\, it has helped me to love the sister
 s I visit and to have a better spirit as I've shared messages with them. S
 ometimes obedience will be inconvenient\, but it will always be the right 
 thing to do.</p></div><p style="text-align: left\;">&nbsp\;</p><p style="t

 *******************\nChange Something Up Research Essay \n***************
 ********************\n\n**************************\nAssignment Sheet - ENG
  150\n**************************\n\n-----------------\nVital Information\n
 -----------------\n\nAudience: Your Instructor and your peers\n\nPurpose: 
 To practice gathering primary and secondary research and then synthesizing
  that data into a coherent narrative/reflective essay\n\nGenre: Experienti
 al essay in a modified IMRD format\n\nStance: Fun but scientific and relia
 ble\n\nMedium: Multimedia alphabetic text (may also images and other media
 )\n\nLength: Roughly 1250-1750 words\n\nExperiment duration: Two weeks\n\
 n \n\n---------------------\nAssignment Background\n---------------------
 \n\nA popular genre in contemporary non-fiction is the short-term personal
  experiment report. Search “30-day experiment” on youtube or google an
 d you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an eff
 ort to improve and then reporting on the results. \n\n---------\nYour Tas
 k\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: Y
 ou will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as 
 a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts\, you’ll mak
 e predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two wee
 ks\, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You wil
 l also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment an
 d compare your results to theirs\, as well as find out more information ab
 out how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it 
 affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a ro
 ughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introducti
 on\, Methods\, Results\, Discussion) format—like a typical lab report\, 
 but with narrative elements.\n\n \n\nResearch Requirements \n-----------
 -----------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find
  and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people a
 re doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to
  put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are 
 typically affected by doing what you did\, and (3) experiences of other pe
 ople who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happe
 ned during their experiment and what their results were\, and compare your
  results to theirs). \n\n \n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nW
 here it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatist
 a\n\nGoogle \n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nGoogle Schola
 r\n\n \n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMet
 hods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people’s experiences\n\nYo
 uTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n
 \n(methods)\n\n \n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction \
 n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and resear
 ch (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give t
 he reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things yo
 u could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea ab
 out what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept
  to them.\n\n* Methods \n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you esta
 blished for yourself \n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the 
 experiment\, you might explain it here\, or you might save that for later 
 in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you c
 hose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question\, tell them wh
 at you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n*
  Results \n\n* Present\, with vivid details\, a few select and important 
 events of the experiment \n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview o
 f the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them availab
 le (e.g. “I did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the expe
 riment.”)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments wh
 ere you learned something about life or about yourself because of the expe
 riment\n\n* Discussion \n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the 
 experiment\n\n* Don’t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate 
 (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the impl
 ications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs yo
 u needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have t
 o stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results 
 and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours\, and
  compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your rel
 ationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------
 \nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment
 \, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too m
 uch of\, start doing something you feel you don’t do enough of\, or do s
 omething you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to 
 be transparent about your efforts\, you will want to choose something that
  a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n \n\nEach experience you have 
 during your experiment is worthy of writing about\, even (maybe especially
 ) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write
  in your notes\, remember that the more often you write about your experie
 nces during the experiment\, the better your final piece will be. Most stu
 dents write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of th
 e experiment.\n\n \n\nWhatever you choose to do\, realize that it is goin
 g to (and should) disrupt your life\, and that you are going to have to ma
 ke accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you a
 re choosing to add something to your life\, you are going to have to give 
 up something else\; likewise\, if you are trying to take something out of 
 your life\, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that
  space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you h
 ad to make in order to change this part of your life up. \n\nHere are som
 e examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You
  could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of 
 service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through
  a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form o
 f exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-
 Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go t
 o the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Po
 st your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each d
 ay\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For ex
 ample\, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you
  have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 wo
 rds of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 1
 4-day social media fast\n\n \n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping
  track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where yo
 u will keep your notes\, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or 
 something similar. If you write on paper\, you could use a spiral-bound no
 tebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really q
 uickly myself\, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to k
 eep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes\, writi
 ng your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse
  final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes\, s
 o make sure you have them in a format that works for that. \n------------

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --\n\nIn your notes\, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts\,
  lasts\, mosts\, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why y
 ou choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also\, you’ll want n
 otes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do\, and also
  from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life. \n\n-----
 ---------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-----------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is 
 a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own e
 xperiences)\, and secondary research (the experiences and research of othe
 rs). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in represen
 ting where your outside information is coming from through in-text citatio
 ns and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using M
 LA formatting we have been learning all semester\, and include an MLA work
 s cited page.\n-----------------------------------------------------------

 nAssignment Sheet - ENG 150\n**************************\n\n---------------
 --\nVital Information\n-----------------\n\nAudience: Your Instructor and 
 your peers\n\nPurpose: To practice gathering primary and secondary researc
 h and then synthesizing that data into a coherent narrative/reflective ess
 ay\n\nGenre: Experiential essay in a modified IMRD format\n\nStance: Fun b
 ut scientific and reliable\n\nMedium: Multimedia alphabetic text (may also
  images and other media)\n\nLength: Roughly 1250-1750 words\n\nExperiment 
 duration: Two weeks\n\n \n\n---------------------\nAssignment Background
 \n---------------------\n\nA popular genre in contemporary non-fiction is 
 the short-term personal experiment report. Search “30-day experiment” 
 on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changin
 g their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results. 
 \n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doi
 ng something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary ev
 ery day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experimen
 t starts\, you’ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect 
 you. During the two weeks\, you will keep a journal of field notes about y
 our experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same o
 r similar experiment and compare your results to theirs\, as well as find 
 out more information about how and why making this change matters or could
  affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn 
 your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay writ
 ten in IMRD (Introduction\, Methods\, Results\, Discussion) format—like 
 a typical lab report\, but with narrative elements.\n\n \n\nResearch Requ
 irements \n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources tha
 t you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statisti
 cs on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your
  experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific rese
 arch on how people are typically affected by doing what you did\, and (3) 
 experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experi
 ment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results 
 were\, and compare your results to theirs). \n\n \n\nResearch Requiremen
 t\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\n
 Pew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle \n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Re

  people’s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid ad
 vertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n \n\nEssay Structure\n-------
 --------\n\n* Introduction \n\n* Give background of your previous experie
 nce with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualize
 s your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experi
 ment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to a
 n audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is.
  Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods \n\n* Explain the rul
 es of the experiment you established for yourself \n\n* If your rules cha
 nged at any point during the experiment\, you might explain it here\, or y
 ou might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hop
 ed to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your res
 earch question\, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention 
 to during the experiment\n\n* Results \n\n* Present\, with vivid details\
 , a few select and important events of the experiment \n\n* Begin this se
 ction with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard num
 bers if you have them available (e.g. “I did my experiment successfully 
 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.”)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narr
 ative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about
  yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion \n\n* Reflect on what
  you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don’t introduce any new res
 ults here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or 
 failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n
 \n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experim
 ent work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successf
 ul)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a simi
 lar experiment to yours\, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project 
 into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forwar
 d\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n-----------------
 -------\n\nFor the experiment\, you will need to either stop doing somethi
 ng you feel that you do too much of\, start doing something you feel you d
 on’t do enough of\, or do something you currently do already in a totall
 y different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts\, you will 
 want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n 
 \n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing a
 bout\, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requir
 ements for how much you write in your notes\, remember that the more often
  you write about your experiences during the experiment\, the better your 
 final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages o
 f notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n \n\nWhatever you choose to
  do\, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life\, and tha
 t you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your l
 ife is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life\, y
 ou are going to have to give up something else\; likewise\, if you are try
 ing to take something out of your life\, you are going to have to decide n
 ow what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk a
 bout the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of yo
 ur life up. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every d
 ay\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or
  Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old frie
 nd or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each
  morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you a
 re grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know th
 em for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or j
 ust sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a mess
 age or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you ha
 ve forgotten each day. For example\, try drawing something every day or pl
 ay the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn some
 thing new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of 
 scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\nManaging Your Note
 s\n\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. Y
 ou may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes\, or use a n
 ote taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on 
 paper\, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially 
 for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself\, so I am not going t
 o do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the who
 le time. If you lose your notes\, writing your paper will be extremely dif
 ficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day 
 in class where you bring your notes\, so make sure you have them in a form
 at that works for that.\n\nIn your notes\, you will want to record meaning
 ful moments: firsts\, lasts\, mosts\, when things feel new or difficult or
  easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. A
 lso\, you’ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you c
 hose to do\, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of 
 your life.\n\nUse of Sources\n\nThis is a research assignment. You will be
  doing both primary research (your own experiences)\, and secondary resear
 ch (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this as
 signment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside informatio
 n is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. Y
 ou will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learnin
 g all semester\, and include an MLA works cited page.\n\n \n\n

 Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm</

 <span>There are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. 
 You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes\, or use a 
 note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on
  paper\, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially
  for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself\, so I am not going 
 to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the wh
 ole time. If you lose your notes\, writing your paper will be extremely di
 fficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day
  in class where you bring your notes\, so make sure you have them in a for
 mat that works for that.</span><br><br><span>In your notes\, you will want
  to record meaningful moments: firsts\, lasts\, mosts\, when things feel n
 ew or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experim
 ent or recommit. Also\, you’ll want notes from when you are actually doi
 ng the thing you chose to do\, and also from when you see it have effects 
 in other parts of your life.</span><br><br><span>Use of Sources</span><br>
 <br><span>This is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary re
 search (your own experiences)\, and secondary research (the experiences an
 d research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meti
 culous in representing where your outside information is coming from throu
 gh in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integr
 ate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester\, and i
 nclude an MLA works cited page.</span></div>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</

DESCRIPTION:--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opp
 ortunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your class
 mates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week\, desig
 ned to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the s
 criptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discu
 ssion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussio
 n fall on the same days as other activities this week\, each post in this 
 discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be
  most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstruction
 s\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity\, you will share three post
 s throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual ins
 tructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific gra
 ding criteria\, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses
 /341216/files/147260780/preview)  button at the top of this window and ch
 oose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n-------------------------
 -\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningf
 ul for you and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mo
 untain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from th
 e assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to ad
 d the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to
  find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and pu
 t it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that princi
 ple and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: "There
 fore go\, my son\, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast
  not murmured." 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7\, but in reading 1 Nephi 3
 :6 this time\, I noticed something I hadn't focused on before. Nephi isn't
  just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem\; he's blessed beca
 use he does so with a good attitude. After all\, Laman and Lemuel make the
  trip\, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedien
 ce isn't just completing the action the Lord requires\, like going home te
 aching\, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude\, like goin
 g home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n \n
 \nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInst
 ructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for yo
 u and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain t
 ime).\n\nFor the second post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Try t
 o add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your 
 classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader\
 , and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understan
 ding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\
 nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when w
 e face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi's cas
 e\, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me re
 alize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I 
 just thought it was a three-day trip one way\, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks a
 bout when Lehi "had traveled three days in the wilderness . . . ." But the
  Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first "came down by
  the borders near the shore of the Red Sea" (1 Nephi 5:6)\, which is "abou
 t 180 miles through hot\, barren country infested anciently by many maraud
 ers." Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness\, this means
  that the whole trip was "at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way."
  This was not an easy task\, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is b
 ecause of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that
  he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n \n\nPost 
 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n---
 ---------\n\nFor the third post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Pi
 ck a post that you can make a personal application to. You can share a bri
 ef story of when you have seen that principle in your life\, identify a wa
 y you are currently trying to live that principle\, or share an example of
  a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nE
 xample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I h
 ad first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then 
 abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days\, retrieve something we left b
 ehind\, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip—that's 42
  days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge in
 convenience. In my life\, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a tas
 k like that\, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit 
 that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience 
 for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However\
 , I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment\, it has h
 elped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I've s
 hared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient\, but i
 t will always be the right thing to do.\n\n \n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete
  all instructions in this activity before considering it complete.

 \n-What is the best solution for homelessness? Is "housing first" a good p
 olicy? \n\n-What is the best solution to crime? What are the merits of cr
 iminal justice reform\, bail reform\, and "harm reduction" policies? \n\n
 -Should California and other states ban the sale of new gas cars by 2035? 
 Should the government continue to subsidize the sale of electric vehicles 
 with tax breaks? \n\n-Should the government subsidize the sale of solar p
 anels for homeowners? \n\n-What are the effects of religion on teenagers 
 and young adults? \n\n-Should all states ban minors from tanning beds? \
 n\n-Should social media platforms censor speech? Should hate speech be ban
 ned? Should certain books be taken out of school libraries? \n\n-Is homes

DESCRIPTION:--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opp
 ortunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your class
 mates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week\, desig
 ned to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the s
 criptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discu
 ssion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussio
 n fall on the same days as other activities this week\, each post in this 
 discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be
  most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstruction
 s\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity\, you will share three post
 s throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual ins
 tructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific gra
 ding criteria\, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses
 /341216/files/147260780/preview)  button at the top of this window and ch
 oose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n-------------------------
 -\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningf
 ul for you and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mo
 untain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from th
 e assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to ad
 d the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to
  find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and pu
 t it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that princi
 ple and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: "There
 fore go\, my son\, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast
  not murmured." 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7\, but in reading 1 Nephi 3
 :6 this time\, I noticed something I hadn't focused on before. Nephi isn't
  just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem\; he's blessed beca
 use he does so with a good attitude. After all\, Laman and Lemuel make the
  trip\, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedien
 ce isn't just completing the action the Lord requires\, like going home te
 aching\, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude\, like goin
 g home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n \n
 \nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInst
 ructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for yo
 u and your classmates\, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain t
 ime).\n\nFor the second post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Try t
 o add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your 
 classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader\
 , and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understan
 ding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\
 nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when w
 e face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi's cas
 e\, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me re
 alize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I 
 just thought it was a three-day trip one way because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks abo
 ut when Lehi "had traveled three days in the wilderness . . ." But the Ins
 titute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first "came down by the
  borders near the shore of the Red Sea" (1 Nephi 5:6)\, which is "about 18
 0 miles through a hot\, barren country infested anciently by many marauder
 s." Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness\, this means t
 hat the whole trip was "at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way." T
 his was not an easy task\, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is bec
 ause of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that h
 e was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n \n\nPost 03
  Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n-----
 -------\n\nFor the third post\, you will reply to a classmate's post. Pick
  a post that you can make a personal application to. You can share a brief
  story of when you have seen that principle in your life\, identify a way 
 you are currently trying to live that principle\, or share an example of a
  friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExa
 mple\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had
  first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then ab
 ruptly being asked to travel back 14 days\, retrieve something we left beh
 ind\, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip—that's 42 d
 ays of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inco
 nvenience. In my life\, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task 
 like that\, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit th
 at sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience fo
 r me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However\, 
 I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment\, it has hel
 ped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I've sha
 red messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient\, but it 
 will always be the right thing to do.\n\n \n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete a
 ll instructions in this activity before considering it complete.

 quote as part of the introduction.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe what you 
 learned and how it helped you overcome a misconception or concern about wr
 iting. You may or may not incorporate a quote from an outside source here\
 , but you will need to include two quotes from different sources somewhere
  in the reflection.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe another thing you learne
 d and how it helped you overcome either the same misconception/concern or 
 a different misconception/concern about writing.\n\n* More Body Paragraphs
 : Add more descriptions of your learning and growth as needed/desired.\n\n
 * Conclusion: Briefly summarize the most important things you learned\, an
 d describe how you plan to use what you've learned beyond this class. In o
 ther words\, how has this class helped you to be an effective communicator
