        "Description": "--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opportunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your classmates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week, designed to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the scriptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discussion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussion fall on the same days as other activities this week, each post in this discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstructions\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity, you will share three posts throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual instructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific grading criteria, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/341216/files/147260780/preview) \u00A0button at the top of this window and choose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n--------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Tuesday.\u00A0\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to add the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words, and put it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \u0022Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\u0022 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn\u0027t focused on before. Nephi isn\u0027t just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he\u0027s blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn\u0027t just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday.\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi\u0027s case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \u0022had traveled three days in the wilderness . . . .\u0022 But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \u0022came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\u0022 (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \u0022about 180 miles through hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\u0022 Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \u0022at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\u0022 This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can either share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that\u0027s 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I\u0027ve shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00A0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete."

Search \u201C30-day experiment\u201D on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results.\u00A0\n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts, you\u2019ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs, as well as find out more information about how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format\u2014like a typical lab report, but with narrative elements.\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirements\u00A0\n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you did, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results were, and compare your results to theirs).\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle\u00A0\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\n\u00A0\n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMethods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people\u2019s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n\u00A0\n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction\u00A0\n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods\u00A0\n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself\u00A0\n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the experiment, you might explain it here, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results\u00A0\n\n* Present, with vivid details, a few select and important events of the experiment\u00A0\n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. \u201CI did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.\u201D)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion\u00A0\n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of, start doing something you feel you don\u2019t do enough of, or do something you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n\u00A0\n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in your notes, remember that the more often you write about your experiences during the experiment, the better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n\u00A0\n\nWhatever you choose to do, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00A0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\n\u00A0\n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\n-------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\u00A0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\u00A0\n\n--------------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

Search \u201C30-day experiment\u201D on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results.\u00A0\n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts, you\u2019ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs, as well as find out more information about how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format\u2014like a typical lab report, but with narrative elements.\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirements\u00A0\n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you did, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results were, and compare your results to theirs).\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle\u00A0\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nScholar\n\nLibrary Website\n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMethods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people\u2019s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n\u00A0\n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction\u00A0\n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods\u00A0\n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself\u00A0\n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the experiment, you might explain it here, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results\u00A0\n\n* Present, with vivid details, a few select and important events of the experiment\u00A0\n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. \u201CI did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.\u201D)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion\u00A0\n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of, start doing something you feel you don\u2019t do enough of, or do something you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n\u00A0\n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in your notes, remember that the more often you write about your experiences during the experiment, the better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n\u00A0\n\nWhatever you choose to do, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00A0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\nManaging Your Notes\n\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\n\nUse of Sources\n\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0"

        "Description": "--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opportunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your classmates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week, designed to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the scriptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discussion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussion fall on the same days as other activities this week, each post in this discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstructions\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity, you will share three posts throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual instructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific grading criteria, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/341216/files/147260780/preview) \u00A0button at the top of this window and choose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n--------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mountain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to add the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and put it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \u0022Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\u0022 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn\u0027t focused on before. Nephi isn\u0027t just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he\u0027s blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn\u0027t just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain time).\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader, and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi\u0027s case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \u0022had traveled three days in the wilderness . . . .\u0022 But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \u0022came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\u0022 (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \u0022about 180 miles through hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\u0022 Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \u0022at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\u0022 This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that\u0027s 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I\u0027ve shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00A0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete."

Do some general research on Google or Wikipedia to learn more about your topic.\u00A0\n\nThen, write 1-2 pages about the background of your topic, common arguments you have heard, and questions that you want to answer. You could also write about how your topic fits with the five stasis points.\n\nFor example, if you chose to write about homeschooling, you might include these questions and your initial answers:\n\nFacts: How many children are being homeschooled in the USA?\n\nDefinition: What counts as home-schooling? What about online schools, dual-enrollment, etc.\u00A0\n\nCause/effect: Why is homeschooling becoming more popular?\u00A0\n\nEvaluation: Does homeschooling help or harm kids academically? Does it help or harm kids socially?\n\nProposal: Should there be more government oversight for homeschooling? Should parents get tax money to help them educate their kids? Should parents choose homeschooling?\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nAs always, bring a paper copy to class.\n\nHere are some topics that you might want to choose, but you are not limited to these options:\n\n-Is online dating a good way to meet a spouse?\u00A0\u00A0\n\n-Is it better to grow up with lots of siblings or few siblings?\n\n-Is it better to get married at a younger age or an older age?\u00A0\n\n-What are the solutions to the drug and Fentanyl problems in the US?\n\n-Should transgender athletes compete with female athletes?\u00A0\n\n-Should states ban hormone blockers, cross-sex hormones, and/or sex-change surgeries for minors?\u00A0\n\n-What can be done about illegal immigration?\u00A0\u00A0\n\n-Should the federal government forgive student loan debt?\u00A0\n\n-What is the value of a college degree?\u00A0\n\n-Is nuclear power safe and effective, or should nuclear power plants be shut down?\u00A0\n\n-What are the effects of smartphones, screen time, and/or social media on mental health?\n\n-Is physical discipline like spanking effective in parenting?\n\n-Should marijuana be legalized recreationally in every state?\u00A0\n\n-Should we raise the federal minimum wage to $15?\n\n-Should states ban abortion? If so, at what stage in the pregnancy? How should abortion laws be enforced?\u00A0\n\n-Should colleges practice affirmative action in admissions? Should employers use affirmative action in hiring?\u00A0\n\n-What is the best solution for homelessness? Is \u0022housing first\u0022 a good policy?\u00A0\n\n-What is the best solution to crime? What are the merits of criminal justice reform, bail reform, and \u0022harm reduction\u0022 policies?\u00A0\n\n-Should California and other states ban the sale of new gas cars by 2035? Should the government continue to subsidize the sale of electric vehicles with tax breaks?\u00A0\n\n-Should the government subsidize the sale of solar panels for homeowners?\u00A0\n\n-What are the effects of religion on teenagers and young adults?\u00A0\n\n-Should all states ban minors from tanning beds?\u00A0\n\n-Should social media platforms censor speech? Should hate speech be banned? Should certain books be taken out of school libraries?\u00A0\n\n-Is homeschooling good for kids?\u00A0\n\n-What are the benefits or harms of standardized testing?\u00A0\n\n-What forms of exercise are the most effective? Is weight training more effective than aerobic exercise? What about things like HIT, supplements, etc.?\u00A0\n\n-What are the effects of gratitude on happiness?\u00A0\n\n\u00A0"

        "Description": "--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opportunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your classmates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week, designed to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the scriptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discussion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussion fall on the same days as other activities this week, each post in this discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstructions\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity, you will share three posts throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual instructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific grading criteria, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/341216/files/147260780/preview) \u00A0button at the top of this window and choose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n--------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mountain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to add the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and put it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \u0022Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\u0022 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn\u0027t focused on before. Nephi isn\u0027t just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he\u0027s blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn\u0027t just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain time).\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader, and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi\u0027s case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \u0022had traveled three days in the wilderness . . .\u0022 But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \u0022came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\u0022 (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \u0022about 180 miles through a hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\u0022 Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \u0022at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\u0022 This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that\u0027s 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I\u0027ve shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00A0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete."

You must use at least one quote from L. Lennie Irvin\u0027s \u0022What Is \u0027Academic\u0027 Writing?\u0022 and one quote from E. Shelley Reid\u2019s \u201CTen Ways to Think About Writing: Metaphoric Musings for College Writing Students.\u201D You are, of course, welcome to include more than just one quote from each article and to summarize or paraphrase ideas from the articles as well.\n\n*\n\n* [What Is Academic Writing_Irvin_ENG150 Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015482?wrap=1)\u00A0\n\n* [Ten Ways To Think About Writing_Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015484?wrap=1)\u00A0\n\n* Begin writing a 1.5\u20132 page reflection paper. Follow these instructions as you do so:\n\n* Write a rough draft or outline of your reflection. There are many ways to organize a reflection essay, but the basic organization should include the following.\n\n* Introduction: Describe your mindset at the beginning of ENG 150, and share some of the misconceptions or initial concerns you may have had. You may or may not use a quote as part of the introduction.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe what you learned and how it helped you overcome a misconception or concern about writing. You may or may not incorporate a quote from an outside source here, but you will need to include two quotes from different sources somewhere in the reflection.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe another thing you learned and how it helped you overcome either the same misconception/concern or a different misconception/concern about writing.\n\n* More Body Paragraphs: Add more descriptions of your learning and growth as needed/desired.\n\n* Conclusion: Briefly summarize the most important things you learned, and describe how you plan to use what you\u0027ve learned beyond this class. In other words, how has this class helped you to be an effective communicator in future writing situations?\n\n* Last, but not least, consider formatting. What have you learned about expectations for academic style (usually MLA or APA)? What have you learned about citing sources?\u00A0 Be sure to show (and not just tell) your instructor what you\u2019ve learned.\n\n* Submit your completed reflection by the due date.\n\nHelpful Hints\n-------------\n\n* Be sure to support your ideas about learning to write in ENG 150 with meaningful and specific evidence from your experiences in the course. In other words, don\u0027t just say, \u0022This class taught me how to write.\u0022 Instead, give specific examples of what you didn\u0027t know (or thought you knew) and then describe how and why you changed throughout the semester. Be sure to mention specifics like assigned readings, homework, conferences, and other activities that either helped (or didn\u0027t help) you along the way.\n\n* Be sure to format the citations correctly at the end of your essay. The final citations for the articles should look like this:\n\nAPA Format\n\nIrvin, L. L. (2010). What is \u0022academic\u0022 writing? In C. Lowe and P.

See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \u0022Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\u0022 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn\u0027t focused on before. Nephi isn\u0027t just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he\u0027s blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn\u0027t just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday.\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi\u0027s case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way, because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \u0022had traveled three days in the wilderness . . . .\u0022 But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \u0022came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\u0022 (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \u0022about 180 miles through hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\u0022 Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \u0022at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\u0022 This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can either share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that\u0027s 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I\u0027ve shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00A0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete."

        "Description": "--------\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis discussion board is an opportunity for you to share scriptural insights and to learn from your classmates and instructor. Three posts are required throughout the week, designed to build upon each other to help you better understand and apply the scriptures in your life. Your instructor will also be involved in the discussion.\n\nNOTE: Though the actual due date and end date for this discussion fall on the same days as other activities this week, each post in this discussion has a recommended day of the week to post in order for it to be most meaningful for you and your classmates.\n\n------------\nInstructions\n------------\n\n* To complete this activity, you will share three posts throughout the week by their posted due dates. Follow the individual instructions and examples for the three posts below.\n\n* To see specific grading criteria, select the [3 Dots.] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/341216/files/147260780/preview) \u00A0button at the top of this window and choose Show rubric.\n\nPost 01 Scriptural Insight\n--------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Tuesday (mountain time).\n\n* Copy and Paste (or type) a passage of scripture from the assigned reading that teaches a meaningful principle.\n\n* Be sure to add the reference to the scripture passage so others can know where to go to find it.\n\n* Identify or restate that principle in your own words and put it in bold font. See the example below.\n\n* Briefly discuss that principle and its significance to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 01: \u0022Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.\u0022 1 Nephi 3:6. I love 1 Nephi 3:7, but in reading 1 Nephi 3:6 this time, I noticed something I hadn\u0027t focused on before. Nephi isn\u0027t just blessed for being willing to return to Jerusalem; he\u0027s blessed because he does so with a good attitude. After all, Laman and Lemuel make the trip, but they do so begrudgingly. This makes me think that real obedience isn\u0027t just completing the action the Lord requires, like going home teaching, he also requires that we obey with the right attitude, like going home teaching joyfully with a desire to bless and uplift others.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 02 Increased Understanding\n-------------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor this discussion to be most meaningful for you and your classmates, we recommend completing it by Thursday (mountain time).\n\nFor the second post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Try to add further insight or understanding into one of the posts made by your classmates by sharing a related scripture or a quote from a church leader, and then explaining how you feel it adds additional insight or understanding to the scripture or principle being discussed.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 02: This is a great insight. It is very hard not to murmur when we face a difficult task that we wish would be a lot easier. In Nephi\u0027s case, I learned something in studying the Institute manual that helped me realize how great his sacrifice was in making the trip back to Jerusalem. I just thought it was a three-day trip one way because 1 Nephi 2:6 talks about when Lehi \u0022had traveled three days in the wilderness . . .\u0022 But the Institute Manual pointed out that Lehi and his family first \u0022came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea\u0022 (1 Nephi 5:6), which is \u0022about 180 miles through a hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.\u0022 Combined with three days of traveling in the wilderness, this means that the whole trip was \u0022at least a twelve-to-fourteen-day trip one way.\u0022 This was not an easy task, but Nephi does not murmur and I think it is because of his great faith in the Lord and desire to do what was right that he was able to tackle this challenge with a good attitude.\n\n\u00A0\n\nPost 03 Personal Application\n----------------------------\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nFor the third post, you will reply to a classmate\u0027s post. Pick a post that you can make a personal application to. You can share a brief story of when you have seen that principle in your life, identify a way you are currently trying to live that principle, or share an example of a friend or family member who has exemplified that principle to you.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nStudent 03: I can imagine being quite frustrated if I had first been asked by my dad to leave our city on a 14-day trip and then abruptly being asked to travel back 14 days, retrieve something we left behind, and then being asked to return for another 14-day trip\u2014that\u0027s 42 days of traveling! I might think it was a big waste of time and a huge inconvenience. In my life, the prophet has not asked me to accomplish a task like that, but he has asked me to serve as a visiting teacher. I admit that sometimes I feel like this assignment can feel like an inconvenience for me since I have very little free time as a student right now. However, I know that when I have a good attitude about this assignment, it has helped me to love the sisters I visit and to have a better spirit as I\u0027ve shared messages with them. Sometimes obedience will be inconvenient, but it will always be the right thing to do.\n\n\u00A0\n\nNOTE: Be sure to complete all instructions in this activity before considering it complete."

Search \u201C30-day experiment\u201D on youtube or google and you will find an endless stream of people changing their lives in an effort to improve and then reporting on the results.\u00A0\n\n---------\nYour Task\n---------\n\nFor this assignment you will be doing something similar: You will need to do something out of the ordinary every day for 14 days as a primary research experiment. Before the experiment starts, you\u2019ll make predictions about how the experiment will affect you. During the two weeks, you will keep a journal of field notes about your experience. You will also research if anyone else has tried the same or similar experiment and compare your results to theirs, as well as find out more information about how and why making this change matters or could affect you and how it affects other people typically. You will then turn your writings into a roughly 1250-1750 word reflective research essay written in IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format\u2014like a typical lab report, but with narrative elements.\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirements\u00A0\n----------------------\n\nThere are three types of sources that you will need to find and incorporate into this assignment: (1) statistics on how many people are doing something similar to what you did for your experiment in order to put your experience in context (2) scientific research on how people are typically affected by doing what you did, and (3) experiences of other people who have done something similar to your experiment (review what happened during their experiment and what their results were, and compare your results to theirs).\u00A0\n\n\u00A0\n\nResearch Requirement\n\nWhere to look\n\nWhere it will be in the paper\n\n1\n\nStatistics\n\nPew Research\n\nStatista\n\nGoogle\u00A0\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\nScientific Research\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\n\u00A0\n\nNever in the Results section\n\nIntroduction (motivated)\n\nMethods\n\nDiscussion (make sense)\n\n3\n\nOther people\u2019s experiences\n\nYouTube\n\nMedium\n\nGoogle search\n\n(avoid advertisements)\n\nDiscussion\n\n(methods)\n\n\u00A0\n\nEssay Structure\n---------------\n\n* Introduction\u00A0\n\n* Give background of your previous experience with the topic and research (especially statistics) that contextualizes your experience\n\n* Give the reader some idea why you chose this experiment out of all the things you could have done\n\n* Remember to write to an audience who has no idea about what a Change Something Up experiment is. Introduce the entire concept to them.\n\n* Methods\u00A0\n\n* Explain the rules of the experiment you established for yourself\u00A0\n\n* If your rules changed at any point during the experiment, you might explain it here, or you might save that for later in the results section\n\n* Tell what you hoped to gain from it when you chose it\n\n* You might also bring up your research question, tell them what you specifically decided to pay attention to during the experiment\n\n* Results\u00A0\n\n* Present, with vivid details, a few select and important events of the experiment\u00A0\n\n* Begin this section with a brief overview of the entire experiment and give any hard numbers if you have them available (e.g. \u201CI did my experiment successfully 11 of the 14 days of the experiment.\u201D)\n\n* Present mini-stories or narrative vignettes of moments where you learned something about life or about yourself because of the experiment\n\n* Discussion\u00A0\n\n* Reflect on what you learned while doing the experiment\n\n* Don\u2019t introduce any new results here\n\n* Self-evaluate (make guesses about why you succeeded and/or failed)\n\n* Discuss the implications for your life based on the results\n\n* Discuss the trade offs you needed to make in order to make the experiment work (what did you have to stop or start doing in order to be successful)\n\n* Present the results and experience of someone else who did a similar experiment to yours, and compare your results to theirs\n\n* Project into the future what your relationship to your topic will be moving forward\n\n------------------------\nChoosing Your Experiment\n------------------------\n\nFor the experiment, you will need to either stop doing something you feel that you do too much of, start doing something you feel you don\u2019t do enough of, or do something you currently do already in a totally different way. In order to be transparent about your efforts, you will want to choose something that a camera could see you doing (or not).\n\n\u00A0\n\nEach experience you have during your experiment is worthy of writing about, even (maybe especially) your failures. Although there are no requirements for how much you write in your notes, remember that the more often you write about your experiences during the experiment, the better your final piece will be. Most students write somewhere between 5 and 8 pages of notes over the course of the experiment.\n\n\u00A0\n\nWhatever you choose to do, realize that it is going to (and should) disrupt your life, and that you are going to have to make accommodations for that disruption. Your life is already full. If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00A0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\n\u00A0\n\n-------------------\nManaging Your Notes\n-------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\u00A0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\u00A0\n\n--------------\nUse of Sources\n--------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

If you are choosing to add something to your life, you are going to have to give up something else; likewise, if you are trying to take something out of your life, you are going to have to decide now what is going to fill that space. Your discussion section should talk about the tradeoffs that you had to make in order to change this part of your life up.\u00A0\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-Write in your journal every day\n\n-Meditate each day. You could use a meditation app like Headspace or Calm\n\n-Do a random act of service each day\n\n-Connect with an old friend or a family member through a phone call each day\n\n-Go for a walk each morning or do another form of exercise\n\n-Write a list of 5 things you are grateful for each day\n\n-Meet a new person each day and get to know them for a few minutes\n\n-Go to the temple each day to do an ordinance or just sit on the grounds\n\n-Post your testimony in some form through a message or on social media each day\n\n-Practice a new hobby or a hobby you have forgotten each day. For example, try drawing something every day or play the violin each day if you have not practiced in a while\n\n-Learn something new each day like 10 words of a new language or memorize a verse of scripture each day\n\n-Do a 14-day social media fast\n\nManaging Your Notes\n\nThere are many options for keeping track of your 14-day experiment. You may choose to keep one file where you will keep your notes, or use a note taking program like Google Keep or something similar. If you write on paper, you could use a spiral-bound notebook or bound journal especially for the project. (I lose paper really quickly myself, so I am not going to do that.) The important thing is to keep a lot of notes safe for the whole time. If you lose your notes, writing your paper will be extremely difficult and you will end up with a worse final product. We will have a day in class where you bring your notes, so make sure you have them in a format that works for that.\n\nIn your notes, you will want to record meaningful moments: firsts, lasts, mosts, when things feel new or difficult or easy. When and why you choose to give up on the experiment or recommit. Also, you\u2019ll want notes from when you are actually doing the thing you chose to do, and also from when you see it have effects in other parts of your life.\n\nUse of Sources\n\nThis is a research assignment. You will be doing both primary research (your own experiences), and secondary research (the experiences and research of others). Part of your job with this assignment is to be meticulous in representing where your outside information is coming from through in-text citations and bibliographic references. You will need to integrate quotes using MLA formatting we have been learning all semester, and include an MLA works cited page.\n\n\u00A0\n\n\u00A0"

You must use at least one quote from L. Lennie Irvin\u0027s \u0022What Is \u0027Academic\u0027 Writing?\u0022 and one quote from E. Shelley Reid\u2019s \u201CTen Ways to Think About Writing: Metaphoric Musings for College Writing Students.\u201D You are, of course, welcome to include more than just one quote from each article and to summarize or paraphrase ideas from the articles as well.\n\n*\n\n* [What Is Academic Writing_Irvin_ENG150 Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015482?wrap=1)\u00A0\n\n* [Ten Ways To Think About Writing_Common Assessment Excerpt.pdf] (https://byui.instructure.com/courses/335578/files/148015484?wrap=1)\u00A0\n\n* Begin writing a 1.5\u20132 page reflection paper. Follow these instructions as you do so:\n\n* Write a rough draft or outline of your reflection. There are many ways to organize a reflection essay, but the basic organization should include the following.\n\n* Introduction: Describe your mindset at the beginning of ENG 150, and share some of the misconceptions or initial concerns you may have had. You may or may not use a quote as part of the introduction.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe what you learned and how it helped you overcome a misconception or concern about writing. You may or may not incorporate a quote from an outside source here, but you will need to include two quotes from different sources somewhere in the reflection.\n\n* Body Paragraph: Describe another thing you learned and how it helped you overcome either the same misconception/concern or a different misconception/concern about writing.\n\n* More Body Paragraphs: Add more descriptions of your learning and growth as needed/desired.\n\n* Conclusion: Briefly summarize the most important things you learned, and describe how you plan to use what you\u0027ve learned beyond this class. In other words, how has this class helped you to be an effective communicator in future writing situations?\n\n* Last, but not least, consider formatting. What have you learned about expectations for academic style (usually MLA or APA)? What have you learned about citing sources?\u00A0 Be sure to show (and not just tell) your instructor what you\u2019ve learned.\n\n* Submit your completed reflection by the due date.\n\nHelpful Hints\n-------------\n\n* Be sure to support your ideas about learning to write in ENG 150 with meaningful and specific evidence from your experiences in the course. In other words, don\u0027t just say, \u0022This class taught me how to write.\u0022 Instead, give specific examples of what you didn\u0027t know (or thought you knew) and then describe how and why you changed throughout the semester. Be sure to mention specifics like assigned readings, homework, conferences, and other activities that either helped (or didn\u0027t help) you along the way.\n\n* Be sure to format the citations correctly at the end of your essay. The final citations for the articles should look like this:\n\nAPA Format\n\nIrvin, L. L. (2010). What is \u0022academic\u0022 writing? In C. Lowe and P.
